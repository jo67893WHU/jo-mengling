abstract: Social media data have been widely used to enrich human-centric
  information for situational awareness and disaster assessment. Owing to the
  granularity of topics detected from disaster-related contents, the
  effectiveness of social media in reflecting disaster losses is still limited.
  To address this limitation, this study developed a methodology for assessing
  disaster losses using social media data, which was composed of data
  preprocessing, fine-grained topic extraction, and quantitative damage
  estimation. The proposed methodology was demonstrated in a case study of
  Typhoons Hato & Pakhar, which caused persistent damage in southern China from
  August 22 to August 30, 2017. The results highlighted the capability of the
  proposed methodology in using fine-grained topics to assess disaster losses,
  e.g., the disaster losses were significantly correlated with infrastructure
  damage-related topics. The study provided useful insights in disaster damage
  assessment through the fine-grained topics in social media.
