abstract: The fine detection of human activity sub-areas of the city is an
  effective basis for realizing the appropriate city resource allocation and
  scientific management. In this paper, we proposed a method of finely dividing
  the urban area using social media data. First, we build a spatial interactive
  network based on a large amount of user movement data obtained from geo-tagged
  social media data. Second, community discovery algorithm in complex networks
  is used to detect the community structure. Then mapping the network
  communities to geospatial and revealing the urban sub-regions structure. We
  detected urban sub-regions in metropolitan area of Wuhan. The experimental
  results show that compared with single travel data, social media data covers a
  wider range of user activity types, which can divide urban space into
  fine-grained sub-regions reflecting people's real activity space with closer
  interaction. Compared with other top-down urban structures, such as
  administrative divisions, the fine-grained urban sub-region structure detected
  in this paper can provide a more detailed basis for urban management.
