abstract: Qualitative spatial reasoning on topological relations can extract
  hidden spatial knowledge from qualitatively described topological information,
  which is of significant importance for decision-making and query optimization
  in spatial analysis. Qualitative reasoning on spatial topological information
  based on semantic knowledge and reasoning rules is an efficient means of
  reducing both the known relations and the corresponding rules, which can
  result in enhanced reasoning performance. This paper proposes a qualitative
  reasoning method for spatial topological relations based on the semantic
  description of reasoning rules and constraint set. Combined with knowledge
  from the Semantic Web, the proposed method can easily extract potential
  spatial results consistent with both unique and non-unique rules. The
  Constraint-Satisfaction-based approach, describing constraint set with
  semantic expressions, is then used together with an improved path consistency
  algorithm to verify the consistency of the unique-rules-based and
  non-unique-rules-based reasoning results. The verification can eliminate
  certain reasoning results to ensure the reliability of the final results.
  Thus, the task of qualitative spatial reasoning on topological relations is
  completed.
