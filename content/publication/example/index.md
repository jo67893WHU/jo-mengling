abstract: Research on the realistic and comprehensive identification of citywide
  spatial patterns of economic segregation is valuable for the sustainable
  development of cities. The consideration of human activities in segregation
  research inspires us to develop an alternative method to contribute to this
  type of research. In our method, we emphasize the combination of collective
  activity spaces (CASs) and spatial economic data, both of which are obtained
  from dynamic human activities. We first reveal the realistic use of urban
  spaces from human mobility patterns to generate multilevel CASs as basic
  analytical units. Then, we use a type of realistic economic data generated
  from human activities to measure the segregation level of each CAS. We realize
  this measurement by tailoring a segregation index, named the Term
  Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency-Index of Concentration at the
  Extremes-based (TFIDF-ICE-based) segregation index, for our economic data.
  Through these methods, we can uncover citywide multilevel spatial patterns of
  economic segregation realistically and comprehensively. Using Beijing and
  Wuhan as cases, we demonstrate and discuss the applicability and value of our
  method.
