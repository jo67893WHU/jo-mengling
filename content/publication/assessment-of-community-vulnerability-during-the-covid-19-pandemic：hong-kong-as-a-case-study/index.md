abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten global public health.
  Reliable assessment of community vulnerability is therefore essential to
  fighting and mitigating the pandemic. This study presents a framework that
  considers the roles of internal and external factors, including the components
  of social vulnerability, exposure, and sensitivity, to comprehensively and
  accurately assess community vulnerability to the pandemic. With respect to
  internal factors, we summarized the inherent social characteristics of people
  groups using census data and explored the roles of both overall and four major
  thematic social vulnerabilities in shaping community infection by COVID-19. We
  then designed two external factors to characterize exposure and sensitivity
  and implemented an aggregation by multiplying them with the internal social
  vulnerability to achieve a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. The role of
  the estimated vulnerability in shaping community infection was evaluated by
  statistical and spatial analysis as well as by risk factor classification
  using defined rules. This case study of Hong Kong demonstrated the value of
  our framework in vulnerability assessment and revealed the role of
  vulnerability in shaping community infection by COVID-19.
