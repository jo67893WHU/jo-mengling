abstract: "The spatial structures of cities have changed dramatically with rapid
  socio-economic development in ways that are not well understood. To support
  urban structural analysis and rational planning, we propose a framework to
  identify urban functional regions and quantitatively explore the intensity of
  the interactions between them, thus increasing the understanding of urban
  structures. A method for the identification of functional regions via spatial
  semantics is proposed, which involves two steps: (1) the study area is
  classified into three types of functional regions using taxi
  origin/destination (O/D) flows; and (2) the spatial semantics for the three
  types of functional regions are demonstrated based on point-of-interest (POI)
  categories. To validate the existence of urban functional regions, we explored
  the intensity of interactions quantitatively between them. A case study using
  POI data and taxi trajectory data from Beijing validates the proposed
  framework. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to
  identify urban functional regions and promotes an enhanced understanding of
  urban structures."
