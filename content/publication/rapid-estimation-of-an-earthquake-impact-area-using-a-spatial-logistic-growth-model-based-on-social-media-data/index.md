abstract: Rapid estimates of impact areas following large earthquakes constitute
  the cornerstone of emergency response scenarios. However, collecting
  information through traditional practices usually requires a large amount of
  manpower and material resources, slowing the response time. Social media has
  emerged as a source of real-time ‘citizen-sensor data’ for disasters and can
  thus contribute to the rapid acquisition of disaster information. This paper
  proposes an approach to quickly estimate the impact area following a large
  earthquake via social media. Specifically, a spatial logistic growth model
  (SLGM) is proposed to describe the spatial growth of citizen-sensor data
  influenced by the earthquake impact strength after an earthquake; a framework
  is then developed to estimate the earthquake impact area by combining social
  media data and other auxiliary data based on the SLGM. The reliability of our
  approach is demonstrated in two earthquake cases by comparing the detected
  areas with official intensity maps, and the time sensitivity of the social
  media data in the SLGM is discussed. The results illustrate that our approach
  can effectively estimate the earthquake impact area. We verify the external
  validity of our model across other earthquake events and provide further
  insights into extracting more valuable earthquake information using social
  media.
