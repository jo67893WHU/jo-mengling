abstract: "Fine-grained subjective partitioning of urban space using human
  activity flows reveals actual human activity spaces with high resolution,
  which has great implications for the development and validation of planning
  strategies. This paper presents a new method for fine-grained subjective
  partitioning of urban space based on the combination of network analysis and
  human interactions from social media. Three main procedures are involved in
  this method: 1) a cut-off point for hierarchical partitioning is determined by
  fitting the probability distribution function of human activity patterns; 2)
  based on this cut-off point, improved hierarchical weighted-directed spatial
  networks are constructed by incorporating a gravity model into conventional
  spatial networks to take into account the importance of the attraction of
  nodes in shaping urban space; and 3) the hierarchical and fine-grained
  partitioning results, which reveal the actual human activity spaces with high
  resolution at multiscale are obtained by implementing a spatial community
  detection algorithm in these networks. A case study, using a real-world
  dataset from the capital of China validates the effectiveness of the proposed
  method. By analyzing the results from Beijing, we concluded that the social
  media, a gravity model, and the hierarchical subjective communities detected
  from the hierarchical human activity networks are all outstanding contributors
  to the fine-grained subjective partitioning of urban spaces."
