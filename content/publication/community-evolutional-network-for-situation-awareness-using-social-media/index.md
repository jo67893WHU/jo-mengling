abstract: Social media is important for situational awareness during a disaster.
  During a disaster, the situation of emergence often changes over time and
  hence the topics of social media messages generated by social media users also
  change accordingly. Few studies quantitatively describe the topic evolution of
  social media during a disaster and the corresponding relationship between
  topic evolution and disaster process. We address this problem using co-word
  network analysis and present a new method based on the community evolution of
  the co-word network to analyze topic evolution over time in social media. The
  method uses communities of the co-word network in social media to represent
  topics. Based on the theory of community evolution, a community evolutional
  network is proposed to support and quantify the evolution of the topics. We
  implemented the proposed method in a case study, “July 2012 Beijing flood”
  using the Sina Weibo dataset. Results show that our method can well quantify
  the evolution process of topics and validate the effectiveness of our method
  in real-world applications. The method can facilitate the understanding of
  public expression dynamics during a disaster and be used to reveal the process
  and stages of a disaster.
