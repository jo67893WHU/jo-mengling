I am Mengling Qiao (乔梦玲), currently a Postdoctoral Fellowship in [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/index.html), at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working with [Prof. Huamin QU](http://huamin.org/).

I have broad research interests lying in urban geography, human mobility, GeoHealth, and socio-spatial computing. Currently, I am focusing on the modeling the spatiotemporal impacts of mobility-based factors on the spread of COVID-19, and the air quality for smart cities.
